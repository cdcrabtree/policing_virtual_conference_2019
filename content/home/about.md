# Welcome!

We invite you to participate in our virtual conference on The Politics of Policing as part of the [Conflict Consortiumâ€™s](https://conflictconsortium.weebly.com/) Virtual Workshop series. Since scholarship on policing spans multiple subfields of political science, the literature on it is somewhat fragmented. Our goal with this virtual conference, which follows a [mini-conference held at the 2018 annual meeting of the Western Political Science Association (WPSA)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i9ayj3ebiifrscb/policing_miniconference_program.pdf?dl=0), is to bring together researchers who work on policing from myriad perspectives and across subfields.
 
The virtual conference will be held daily from 2-3:30pm Eastern on [January 11th](#day_one), [14th](#day_two), and [15th](#day_three) 2019. We will host one 'panel' each day, lasting for 90 minutes. At each panel, 3-4 papers will be presented for 12-15 minutes each. A discussant will comment on the papers for 10 minutes, leaving the remainder of the time open for discussion among the other panelists and online attendees. We will host the conference using BlueJeans meeting software at the links listed below. Presenters will be able to share their slides with others viewing the video stream, panelists will be able to ask questions, and other online attendees will be able to type questions and comments.
