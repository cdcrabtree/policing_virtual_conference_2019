# Audience Instructions
To join a panel, please use the **'Participate in this panel.'** links 
provided throughout this page.

After you click on the first link, you'll be prompted to download the [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/) application. Downloading and installing this application should take fewer than 10 minutes. One you've done that, you should 
access the link once again. At that point, you should automatically join 
the session. If you encounter any problems with the application, you can 
join the session via a link at the bottom of webpage. It says **'Can't 
Launch The App? JOIN WITH BROWSER'.**

Once you join the session, you'll see a series of buttons at the top of 
the application or browser window. After you enter, please click on the 
'Chat' button in the top right. We ask that all audience members provide 
their questions and comments to presenters in this area. Please first 
write the last name of the presenter followed by your comment. After the 
discussant provides comments, the presenters will address questions and 
comments listed in the chat window.

Please also mute your audio when you're not presenting. This will help 
reduce audio feedback and bandwidth issues.
