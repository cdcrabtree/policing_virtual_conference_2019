### The Militarization of Law Enforcement in Latin America 
- [Gustavo Flores-Macias](http://flores-macias.government.cornell.edu/) (Cornell University), [Jessica Zarkin](http://www.cornellpolicyreview.com/author/jzarkin/) (Cornell University)

   Abstract: What are the political consequences of militarizing law enforcement? Across the world, law enforcement has become increasingly militarized over the last three decades, with civilian police operating more like armed forces and soldiers replacing civilian police in law enforcement tasks. Scholarly, policy, and journalistic attention has mostly focused on the first type, but has neglected the study of three main areas toward which this article seeks to contribute: 1) the constabularization of the military—i.e., when the armed forces take on the responsibilities of civilian law enforcement agencies, 2) the extent to which this process has taken place outside of the United States, and 3) its political consequences. Toward this end, this article unpacks the concept of militarized law enforcement, develops theoretical expectations for constabularized militaries, takes stock of constabularization in Latin America, and evaluates whether expected consequences have played out in the region. It shows that the distinction between civilian and military law enforcement typical of democratic regimes has been severely blurred in the region. Further, it argues that the constabularization of the military has had important consequences for the quality of democracy in the region by undermining human rights, citizen security, police reform, and the legal order.

   Abstract: Most organizations specialized in the use of violence (e.g. military, police, insurgencies, criminal organizations or terrorist grouos) are predominantly populated by men. However, women still join these organizations. This study focuses particularly on identifying the structural factors that encourage women to join the police force. By focusing on El Salvador, one of the most violent countries in the world, this study argues that a series of gender-oriented institutional reforms increase the number of women applying to the police. The empirical evidence comes the statistical analysis of ten years (2007-2017) of enrollment applications to the Police Academy in El Salvador using count data and quasi-experimental analysis techniques. Results show that the implementation of a robust institutional framework aiming at promoting gender equity and equality effectively increases the number of female applicants to the Police Academy.

   Abstract: Underwhat conditions do court rulings generate improved human rights outcomes? In this paper, we investigate the extent to which court-ordered accountability institutions can decrease government repression in the form of police violence. We argue that the creation of court-ordered, regional bodies to which citizens report allegations of police abuse provides “fire-alarm” oversight (McCubbins and Schwartz 1984) by which police officers can be monitored for abuses of power. To test the implications of our theory, we take advantage of variance in the implementation of Prakash Singh and Others v. Union of India and Others, a 2006 judgment by the Supreme Court of India requiring states and districts to establish local Police Complaints Authorities (PCAs). Using a difference-in-difference design, we show that the implementation of state PCAs is associated with statistically and substantively significant decreases in human rights violations by Indian police officers. Our theory and empirical results suggest that courts can improve human rights through the creation of accountability institutions.
