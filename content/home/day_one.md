### Police Interactions with Youth at Risk: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Honduras

   Abstract: Gang-driven violence in Central America has imposed high costs on local populations. Despite the scope of the problem, there is little convincing evidence of what works to reduce violence in the region and, in particular, whether police-led interventions can change perceptions in ways that might cripple gangs’ abilities to recruit young people. This paper presents experimental evidence on the effectiveness of a 56- hour violence prevention program, provided by the Honduran National Police to at-risk adolescents (aged 13-18). Out of 164 classrooms in nine schools, 80 were randomly selected to receive the violence prevention program and 84 selected into the control group. Results consistently show few changes in attitudes among students in classrooms that received the program. These findings suggest that in-school pedagogical interventions directed at a broad and heterogeneous group of adolescents may be less effective compared to targeted interventions for young people that can be accurately identified at risk for gang recruitment.

### Elective Enforcement: The Politics of Local Immigration Policing 
- [Asya Magazinnik](https://www.asyamagazinnik.com/) (Princeton University) 

   Abstract: The last two decades have seen a pronounced shift in the focus of American immigration law from patrolling the nation's border to policing its interior. This development has involved local law enforcement agents gaining powers previously held centrally and exclusively by the federal executive. Yet neither the payoffs to the president from this regime nor localities' incentives to participate in it are explained by the current scholarship on immigration or federalism. This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing intergovernmental policymaking in a federated system. An empirical test using the 287(g) program highlights the model's central trade-offs. By deputizing local officers with the powers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, 287(g) induced a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement at almost no federal expense. But the localities that selected into the program wielded their newfound agency differently from their federal counterparts, shifting the focus of policing efforts from felonies to traffic offenses and misdemeanor drug possession. I further present evidence that these decisions were driven by electoral politics, in particular accountability to nativist constituencies.

### 'Everyday Repression': Para-Police and Routine Coercion in China 
- [Lynette H. Ong](https://lynetteong.com/) (University of Toronto) 

   Abstract: This study proposes a new concept of “everyday repression” to describe the use of banal and low-level violence by states to carry out routine coercion against citizens and to acquire citizen’s compliance to unpopular policies. Much like James Scott’s everyday forms of resistance, “everyday repression” is prosaic and routine, and reflects states’ tactical wisdom when the use of official coercive forces is not practical. Unlike organized repressive actions, “everyday repression”, exercised by “street-level bureaucrats”, requires minimal planning and coordination, and low-level of organizational capacity. In China, the “street-level bureaucrats” are the para-police or chengguan, many of whom are poorly trained temporary personnel with thuggish background. In Latin America and other countries, it is often the poorly paid police force, many of which have links with criminal organizations. “Everyday repression” that sits on one end of the “repression repertoire”, incurs low cost and requires low-level of coordination and organizational capacity, compared with organized repression on the other end of the spectrum. Yet, “everyday repression” has low perceived legitimacy, and is less costly for citizens to resist. Hence, it is more likely to result in backlash compared to organized repressive actions. While “everyday repression” maybe an expedient means of control, it often reduces state legitimacy and increases the likelihood of resistance.

### Reaching the Converted: Understanding the Methods of Informant Enrollment 
- [Barbara Maria Piotrowska](https://sites.google.com/site/bmapiotrowska/) (University of Oxford)

   Abstract: A popular understanding of the operation of authoritarian regimes sees them as using repression not only to suppress the opposition directly, but also to force civilians into other forms of cooperation, such as serving as an informant. However, threats can bring about negative outcomes, by causing the informant to provide false information that is costly to verify, and by decreasing loyalty to the regime. This paper considers the way in which a secret police chooses from the toolbox of options available at its disposal to enroll its informants and uses a dataset of informants to the East German Stasi to demonstrate the mechanisms that determine the use of each of them.
