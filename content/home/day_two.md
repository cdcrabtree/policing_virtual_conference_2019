### Too Much Knowledge, Too Little Power: An Assessment of Political Knowledge in Highly-Policed Communities 
- [Vesla Weaver](https://veslaweaver.wordpress.com/) (Johns Hopkins University), [Gwen Prowse](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/gwen-prowse) (Yale University), [Spencer Piston](http://www.spencerpiston.com/) (Boston University)

   Abstract: Studies of citizen competence regularly conclude that ordinary Americans lack the knowledge they need to form meaningful political preferences, leading to inefficient or counterproductive policymaking. Our study of conversations about policing among residents of highly-policed neighborhoods challenges this prevailing account. We find evidence that many participants possess extensive experiential knowledge about political life; that their knowledge is attained through involuntary encounters with the state rather than through civics education; that their knowledge is characterized by dual information about how the state should operate based on written law and how it actually operates as a lived experience; and that they are aware that their views of policing have little impact on policy. Our findings point to a new approach to the conceptualization and measurement of political knowledge and its role in contemporary American democracy.

### Policing and Dissent: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Uganda 
- [Travis Curtice](https://traviscurtice.com/) (Emory University), [Brandon Behlendorf](https://www.albany.edu/cehc/72379.php) (SUNY Albany)

   Abstract: In many countries, the police are both the guardians of public safety and the primary instruments of state repression. Used to quell dissent, many argue their excessive force can drive further collective action, leading to a repression-dissent nexus. Yet does police repression spur dissent for all, or only for those already dissenting? We argue excessive police violence causes political backlash, decreasing support for police and increasing political dissent. Further, we argue these effects are conditioned by individuals' previous collective action, supersede positive support for the police, and are independent of party support. Using a nationally representative survey experiment of 1,920 Ugandans in 194 parishes, we find robust evidence for political backlash effects of repression across all demographics, regardless of previous collective action. By examining the politics of policing in an autocracy, we show excessive state-violence triggers political backlash, increasing expressions of political dissent and decreasing support for the security apparatus.

### Does Gender Representation in Law Enforcement Affect Police Legitimacy? Evidence from India

   Abstract: While social scientists have probed the dynamics of exposure to gender representa- tion in political institutions (Beaman, Chattopadhyay, et al. 2009; Beaman, Du o, et al. 2012), there remains a signi cant literature gap about representation in non-elected bu- reaucratic institutions like the police. A number of nations, from Afghanistan to Liberia, have pushed for greater gender representation in their security and police forces. One consideration is that women serve to moderate the perception of the police which, ac- cording to organizations like Transparency International (TI 2017), suffer from a lack of institutional legitimacy in much of the developing world. We situate this study in India: a country that is not only arguably the most unsafe place for women in the world (Gold- smith and Beresford 2018), but also a setting with low levels of police legitimacy (Stepan, Linz, and Yadav 2011). In such a context, would women police officers add to or detract from the credibility of law enforcement? To answer this puzzle, we utilize the first nationally representative survey of policing, and also implement a novel video-based experiment. In particular, we present realistic news broadcasts to citizens in which the gender of the investigating officer and nature of the crime are manipulated. Our preliminary findings suggest that there is a bias against women in law enforcement, but that the nature of the crime also matters.

### Police Violence and Public Perceptions: An Experimental Study of How Police Performance and Endorsements Affect Support for Law Enforcement

   Abstract: Incidents of police violence can undermine trust in legal authorities. Whether such incidents have this effect will depend on how citizens evaluate victims, the police, and public officials. Citizens’ evaluations may be shaped by information about: 1) other police actions and 2) government responses. We study citizens’ reactions to police violence by randomly assigning these two types of thematic information about the Stephon Clark shooting in Sacramento. We find that thematic information leads non-locals to blame the police more and support state intervention. Locals, however, blame the victim more and increase trust in the police. We demonstrate the importance of these outcomes with another experiment where we randomly assign police endorsements in law enforcement elections. Police endorsements increase candidate support, but only among citizens who trust the police. These results suggest a catch-22 whereby avoiding police violence benefits police organizations, but local opinion insulates them from backlash when it occurs.
